# catchTheEgg
Fun game to play

Game starts with level 1, and the level might be changed in menu, which opens when "Escape" is pressed. 
Principes are pretty easy, you need to move the wolf through arrows in keyboard, and the goal is to collect as many eggs, as it is possible. 

The game ends when you miss your forth egg(after third miss game still goes on), or reach score of -1(in case if you collect the bomb, which gives you -1 point)

There are 3 different levels, with remarkably growing speed in each, while bombs spawn only in level 3.

You can see your score of last game and best score you reached so far as you lose the round.
